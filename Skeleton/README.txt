Description
-----------

The files in this package comprise the Matlab implementation of a
method for skeletonizing binary images.  These are my own implementation
of a skeletonization method communicated to me by Alex Telea
(http://www.win.tue.nl/~alext/).  See his papers for more details.

This implementation is not optimized -- it is designed to be slow but
reliable.  Alex has a faster (non-Matlab) implementation, but I found
that it didn't give the results I wanted in certain situations.
